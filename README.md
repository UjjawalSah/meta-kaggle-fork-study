## 🚀 Hackathon Project
This project was developed as part of the **Meta Kaggle Hackathon**, where I analyzed how **Kaggle kernel forks** contribute to **community knowledge propagation**.  
The goal was to uncover patterns in **fork behavior, peak activity times, and effective kernel styles** that drive knowledge sharing on Kaggle.  

---

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Analysis of kernel fork trends  
- ✅ Identification of high-impact kernel types (tutorials, pipelines)  
- ✅ Temporal activity trends (peak hours & days)  
- ✅ Visualization of community propagation patterns  
- ✅ Insights for Kaggle users to maximize their kernel reach

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Source**: Meta Kaggle Dataset  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter / Kaggle Notebook  
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots & graphs

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meta-kaggle-fork-dynamics.git
   cd meta-kaggle-fork-dynamics
   ```
2. Open the main notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/understanding-kaggle-fork-dynamics.py
   ```
3. Run the cells to reproduce analysis & visualizations.

##🎯 Key Insights

- Clear tutorials drive the highest fork rates

- End-to-end pipelines spread effectively across the community

- Peak activity hour: 20:00 UTC

- Busiest days: Fridays & Tuesdays
