# 📌 **Exploring the Social Graph of Kaggle Notebooks: A Deep Dive into Kernel Fork Dynamics and Community Learning**

**Author:** Ujjawal Kumar

---

## 📖 Introduction  
Kaggle has evolved into more than just a competition platform—it’s a collaborative ecosystem where data scientists and enthusiasts share, learn, and innovate. At the heart of this ecosystem are **Kaggle Kernels** (notebooks), which enable users to explore datasets, develop models, and share insights.

One of the most powerful features Kaggle provides is the ability to **fork** kernels—allowing users to create a copy of an existing notebook to modify or build upon. These forks are not just technical utilities—they represent a **social and intellectual network** of how ideas flow and evolve within the community.

Yet, despite this vibrant behavior, there’s limited deep exploration into what really drives kernel forking. That’s where this project comes in.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement  
While forking activity is visible on Kaggle, **the underlying dynamics and motivations remain unclear**:

- What makes a kernel fork-worthy?
- Is forking influenced by **author reputation**, **competition category**, **content quality**, or **timing**?
- Do forks spark further innovation, or do they merely replicate content?
- How do these behaviors impact **learning outcomes** for beginners and **community growth**?

This project aims to **analyze, visualize, and interpret** the dynamics behind Kaggle kernel forking to uncover meaningful insights for users, educators, and platform designers.

---

## 💡 Key Objectives  

- ✅ **Build a Fork DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** to visualize the parent-child relationships between kernels and their forks.  
- ✅ Identify **the most forked kernels** and analyze factors contributing to their popularity (e.g., author rank, competition type, kernel title).  
- ✅ Detect **forking patterns and trends** over time, such as peak forking periods, top contributors, and influential fork chains.  
- ✅ Answer learner-centric questions like:  
  - _“Which kernels are most helpful for beginners?”_  
  - _“Does forking enhance the quality or originality of the kernel?”_  
- ✅ Provide **actionable insights** for users on how to choose or create kernels that contribute to meaningful learning and collaboration.

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes  

By the end of this project, we expect to deliver:

- 🧠 A **clear understanding of how knowledge flows** through the Kaggle ecosystem via forks  
- 📊 **Visual insights** into kernel popularity and influence through Fork DAGs and time-series plots  
- 🎯 **Best practices** for learners and creators on how to maximize visibility, collaboration, and impact  
- 🔍 A framework to evaluate whether forks lead to **improvement, innovation, or redundancy**

---

## 🧭 Nature of the Project  
This is an **exploratory and storytelling-driven analysis**, rather than a predictive modeling project. It emphasizes:

- Community behavior  
- Visual interpretation  
- Real-time insights  
- Actionable recommendations

---

Let’s uncover how ideas evolve, branch out, and inspire the Kaggle community—one fork at a time. 🚀

"""## 🧹 Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before diving into analysis, it's essential to ensure the datasets are clean, consistent, and optimized for processing. Below is a summary of the cleaning steps applied to each dataset:

### 🔍 Function: `clean_dataset(df, name)`
A universal function is used to clean and preprocess datasets based on their specific requirements.

### ✅ General Cleaning Steps Applied:

1. **Drop Duplicates**:  
   All duplicate rows in each dataset are removed to ensure data integrity.

2. **Handle Missing Values**:  
   - For the **Kernels** dataset, rows missing `CurrentKernelVersionId` or `CreationDate` are removed, as these are essential for kernel tracking and time-based analysis.
   - For the **KernelVersions** dataset, rows missing `ParentScriptVersionId` are removed, which are vital to maintain the version lineage of scripts.

3. **Datetime Conversion**:  
   Columns containing `"date"` or `"time"` in their names are automatically converted into a proper datetime format to simplify any time-based operations and filtering.

4. **Remove Low-Variance Columns**:  
   Columns that contain only a single unique value are dropped, as they do not contribute meaningful information to analysis or modeling.

### 📂 Cleaned Datasets:

- `users`
- `kernels`
- `kernel_tags`
- `forks`
- `kernel_versions`

Each of these datasets goes through the above pipeline and is returned in a cleaned state, ready for exploration and visualization.

ℹ️ This modular approach ensures consistency in cleaning while allowing custom logic for specific datasets when needed.

## 🔁 Visualizing Kernel Fork Relationships as a DAG

In Kaggle, kernels can be "forked" — meaning a user can copy and modify an existing kernel. To better understand how these forks are connected, we can visualize their relationships as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. In this graph, each node represents a kernel version, and each directed edge represents a fork from one kernel to another. This helps us identify how knowledge or code flows across different users and kernels over time.

Below is a Python implementation using `pandas`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib` to build and visualize this fork relationship graph.
"""

import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Ensure forks DataFrame is already loaded
# For example: forks = pd.read_csv("Forks.csv")

# Step 2: Create a directed graph (DAG)
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Step 3: Add edges from SourceKernelVersionId to KernelVersionId
# This means KernelVersionId is a fork of SourceKernelVersionId
for _, row in forks.iterrows():
    parent = row["SourceKernelVersionId"]
    child = row["KernelVersionId"]
    if pd.notnull(parent) and pd.notnull(child):
        G.add_edge(parent, child)

# Step 4: Take a small subgraph for visualization (e.g., first 50 nodes)
sub_nodes = list(G.nodes)[:50]
subgraph = G.subgraph(sub_nodes)

# Step 5: Visualize the DAG
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))
pos = nx.spring_layout(subgraph, seed=42)  # layout for clear spacing
nx.draw(subgraph, pos, with_labels=True, node_color="lightgreen", edge_color="gray", node_size=900, font_size=8, arrowsize=15)

"""### 🔍 Key Insights
- Most forks originate from a few key kernels.
- The graph shows a power-law distribution—some nodes have many edges while most have few.
- The structure resembles a tree, confirming it's a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
### 💡 What I noticed:
Looking at the fork relationships, a few kernels (like ID 2084546 and 2046970) seem to be "parent" kernels. These are likely popular or useful ones others have built upon. The graph makes it clear that kernel development is more like evolution than isolated creation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Analyze Most-Forked Kernels and Key Attributes

1. **Count** how many times each kernel version has been forked.
2. **Map** these versions back to their original kernels and bring in relevant metadata:
   - Title of the kernel version
   - Author information (DisplayName, PerformanceTier)
   - Popularity metrics (TotalViews, TotalVotes, TotalComments)
   - Competition medals (if any)
3. **Identify** the top 10 kernels with the highest fork counts.
4. **Visualize** the results to see which kernels inspire the most forks.

"""## 🔍 Key Insights: Top 10 Most Forked Kernels

- **“stacking, MICE and brutal force”** leads the pack with the highest fork count (≈0.11 forks per user), indicating strong community interest in advanced ensemble and imputation techniques.  
- **“VGG16 Transfer Learning – Pytorch”** ranks second, showing that clear, framework‑specific tutorials on popular architectures attract many reusers.  
- **Kernels combining multiple techniques** (e.g., _“How to get 81%” GRU‑ATT + LGBM + TF‑IDF + EDA_) also score highly, suggesting that end‑to‑end demonstration notebooks are especially fork‑worthy.  
- **“training and validation data pickle”** and **“Deep learning is all you need! LB 0.80X”** highlight that data‑preparation shortcuts and high‑scoring baseline models are popular starting points for new experiments.  
- **Analytical pipelines** (e.g., _“Weighted app, channel, os”_) and **specialized preprocessing scripts** (e.g., _“lewis' UndersampleR, 9562 version”_) show niche utilities can still generate significant forks if they solve common pain points.  
- Even **smaller‑scale models** like _“Bi‑GRU‑CNN‑Poolings”_ make the top list, indicating that succinct, focused examples of modern architectures encourage exploration.

In this section, we perform three key analyses:

1. **Peak Forking Periods**
   - Examine the distribution of forks by hour of day, day of week, and over the calendar timeline.

2. **Top Contributors**
   - Identify the authors whose kernels receive the highest number of forks.

3. **Fork Chain Visualization**
   - Trace a sample fork chain to understand how ideas evolve through multiple forking steps.

## 🎓 Learner-Focused Analysis

In this section, we dive into understanding the real-world utility of Kaggle kernels, especially from a beginner's perspective. Using datasets like `Kernels.csv`, `KernelVotes.csv`, and `Forks.csv`, we aim to answer the following key questions:

1. **Which kernels are most helpful for beginners?**  
   We analyze the *"IsBeginnerFriendly"* attribute in the dataset to identify how many kernels are tagged as beginner-friendly. Further, we compare how often these beginner-friendly kernels are forked by others. This helps us understand which types of kernels are more likely to be reused, learned from, or built upon—valuable insight for new learners deciding which kernels to study.

2. **Does forking improve the kernel’s quality or inspire new ideas?**  
   Forking in Kaggle often indicates that someone found a kernel useful enough to reuse or modify it. To investigate whether forked kernels lead to higher quality content, we compare metrics like:
   - **TotalVotes**: Do forked kernels receive more upvotes?
   - **TotalComments**: Do they spark more discussion and community engagement?

   This helps us understand whether forking is just about reuse or if it actually leads to the creation of better, more interactive content.

---

By the end of this analysis, you’ll gain insights into how beginners can identify impactful kernels and how community collaboration (through forks) contributes to content quality and knowledge sharing on Kaggle.
